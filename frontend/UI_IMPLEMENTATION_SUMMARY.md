## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in `/frontend`:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

---

## How to Run

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

The app will run on **http://localhost:3000** and proxy API requests to **http://localhost:8080**.

---

## Integration with Backend

All services are configured to work with your backend microservices:

- **API Gateway**: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`
- **Auth Service**: `/auth/*`
- **Resume Service**: `/resumes/*`
- **Job Service**: `/jobs/*`
- **Matching Service**: `/match/*, /skills/*`
- **Analytics Service**: `/analytics/*`

The frontend uses JWT tokens stored in localStorage for authentication.
